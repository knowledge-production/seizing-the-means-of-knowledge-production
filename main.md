# Seizing the means of knowledge production

Steps:
* write down two pages outline with core partners (columbia, concordia, clemens)
* break up the outline into clusters of possible work-packages

## Outline

Scholars, or those who take an interest in studying, both within and outside academia, perform a range of everyday tasks as part of their practice. They research, read,  select, annotate, curate, sketch, maintain a reference database or even index card catalog (see N. Luhmann). They write, edit each others' texts, copy-edit, and eventually publish their work in some form. And finally, they teach, share, archive, preserve the knowledges that they are engaged with.

Every single one of these activities, and each of the workflows that compose them, today relies on some digital tool in order to be carried out. And the majority of the tools readily available to scholars, to all those who wish to study and engage with knoweldge, are today commercial products.

An example in case: "On top of their publishing business, Elsevier has built out its 'research intelligence' offering, which now encompases a whole range of digital services, including the Scopus citation database; Mendeley reference manager; the research performance analytics tools SciVal and Research Metrics; the centralised research management system Pure; the institutional repository and publishing platform bepress; and last but not least, grant discovery and funding flow tools Funding Institutional and Elsevier Funding Solutions."  (GrMaMe, Learning from Syllabus 20019) 

Given how central digital tools are becoming in today's universities, schools, museums, archives, libraries, and research centres, whoever owns these platforms stand to greatly impact the processes of knowledge production available to society. The predominance of market-driven solution can present a number of issues, including limiting access and participation in the production and preservation of knowledge (in contrast to the remti fo most public cultural institutions, such as museusm and libraries), but also introduce workflows that might make more sense from the perspective of management than scholars, understood in the broader sense we introduced above. 

Our project 'Seizing The Means of Knowledge Production' wants to tackle this 

set of skills and could be covered by a number of (overlapping) *workflows*. In the age of metrics *workflows* and skills tend to adopt to the productivism's pressures. That means that any commercial product with a promise for better productivity will be either enforced by enthusiastic management or sometimes embraced by anxious researcher.

Our project finds the thin common denominator where skills, *workflows* and tools work together as critical discourse, practice and pedagory in building the infrastructures to seize the means of knowledge production. The common denominator resonates with the history and present of free software, science and culture as well as the radical open access movements. It is the way to avoid, as G. Hall writes in "[Pirate philosophy](https://library.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/9e4351ea-258c-4216-939b-24c7e6b05d47)",

> something hypocritical about radical theorists advocating a politics of the Commons, commoning and communism, yet appearing to let little of this politics have an impact on the decisions they make (or that are made for them) regarding their own work, business, role, and practices as authors.

The relevant knowledge production was never situated only in academia. Today's world makes that even more obvious (as in [Graziano, Medak & Mars](https://library.memoryoftheworld.org/#/book/fa99af52-9821-435e-9d07-0e17eb7c8954)). ~~something about the social movements and their struggles as the space of knowledge production~~

The scope of knowledge in technological environment is a composition of well structured knowledge already formalized in the previous social interactions only to be further developed by technologists to meet the needs of the ones now using what they previously created.

Lead Partner: CPC
Other organisations: Mayday Rooms, HyperReadings, Columbia
Named PI: Valeria
Co-I: Marcell, Kaja, Janneke, Tomi, Sean, Dennis, Alex

**Activities:**

* #Syllabus convention, bringing together the main contirbutors to the recent #syllabi phenomenon.
* Development of an free software platform for sharing, archiving and recombining syllabi
* Development of a workflow complete with video tutorials on how to create one's syllabus (or, a syllabus on how to make a syllabus)
* Archiving of existing #syllabi from social movement onto the platform - this will be organised as a hack-a-ton, a participatory event inviting students and members of the public to participate.
* Launch events of platform tool and archive x2 (one in US; one in UK)

**Deliverables:**

* The creation of a new **online free software platform** for the sharing, archiving and remixing of syllabi primarely concerned with the knowledge created in the context of social justice movements, both emergent and historical.
* The creation of an **archive**, on the same platform, of the recent #syllabi phenomenon (2014 - present)
* A scholarly **publication** on a relevant academic journal of internaitonal standing (e.g. Digital Culture & Education; Internet and Higher Education; Critical Studies in Education)


**PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES (not sure where to insert):**

A core team fo researchers based at CPC (JA, VG, KM, MM, TM) have been collaborating for over a year now on the subject of open and alternative methods of knowledge production, under the name **PostOffice Research Group** (postoffice.media).
The first series of research events by this group, titled **Work, Property, Metrics** was a series of seminars, workshops, and talks investigating the transformations of work, property relations, and mechanisms of social control resulting from the processes of digitisation, computerisation, and automation. These transformations are reflected in a crisis of institutions responsible for the universal access to social goods and services: employment, care, education, housing etc. 

JA and KM organised the **Post-Publishing Programme** and the **Experimental Publishing** seminar series. 

VG first became interested in #syllabi during a research residency at the Digital Cultures Research Lab, Leuphana University, where the collaboration with MM and TM was also initiated. They have been commissioned the chapter 'Learning from #Syllabus' for *State Machines: Reflections and Actions at the Edge of Digital Citizenship, Finance, and Art* (Amsterdam, Institute of Networked Cultures, 2019).

A first pilot workshop testing the collaborative workflow for the online platform was organsied in partnership with MayDay Rooms, London, on 3rd and 4th July 2019. Funding were secured through an internal Springboard Funds scheme at Coventry University and MayDay Rooms. Invited paticipants focused on developing a Housing Struggles Syllabus. They were: Chris Jones, from Southwark Notes, London; Dr Mara Ferreri (UAB), from La Hidra Cooperativa, Barcelona; Dr Ana Vilenica, founding editor, The Radical Housing Journal; and Dr Anthony Iles, Mute Magazine. 

 A second syllabus **was** **(is? will be??)** co-created in the context of the cultural programme Pirate Care, commissioned by the art centre Drugo More, funded as part of Rijeka European Capital of Culture 2020.

## Housing struggles workshop in London (from an email to participants)

The workshop we have in mind would be about creating collaborative open syllabi on specific knowledges related to socio-political struggles and social movements, in our case, housing struggles. This comes after the three of us took some time to think together on that topic. We wrote an article "Learning from #Syllabus" (attached to this email), where we did an outline for what we hope will be a longer term collaborative project. We were inspired with the phenomenon of #syllabus spreading via twitter and social media, but felt that while #syllabus is great for campaigning, it is also important to develop some digital networks, platforms and workflows so those attempts get a chance to do their politics, intervene, adjust, resist and live more long term. Of course, we are not into any tech-solution(ism) here, but some tech is part of the vision ;)

We imagined a workflow based on a low-tech, mostly plain text, writing together with organizing the documents in a such a way that, after a syllabus is finished, one could copy the directory on a USB stick and run away into the forest ready to use it for collective learning. That USB stick would carry an offline syllabus web site that is accessible by click on [Open File] in any web browser *and* a well maintained searchable catalog of all of the reference materials available as local files. There is an initial draft of the web site, following the workflow we propose, which we developed in collaboration with Denis Tennen from http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/ You could check it out here: https://knowledge-production.github.io/forge/

A well-maintained catalog with all the needed files available is something we, at Memory of the World, have been developing for a long time (Anthony will remember as he was the very first beta tester seven years ago) and an example could be checked out here: https://books.memoryoftheworld.org/

We played a bit with a similar workflow here at Coventry and have been successful in developing two web sites (with 3 out of 5 people not being familiar with these workflows before). Those two web sites are: https://postoffice.media/ and https://www.piratecare.net/

As mentioned above, those web sites could be easily copied to any USB stick or the simplest/cheapest web server available. They will not disappear after couple of years, like most of the web sites from our recent past, like the ever-popular wordpresses many activists use and then die after five years. It doesn't depend  on "the cloud", but it would happily parasite on it if needed.

We hope we came up with the workflow proposal which will not come our way or become an intrusive, demanding obstacle, which is often the case with technical tools. We would like to find the minimum level of technical skills shared by enough of participants who work together on the development of the syllabus. What we want to do is to end up with a capacity to work together without a strong threshold of division of labor and expertise. It is rather a continuum where everyone feels comfortable to participate. That's what we would like to achieve with you guys at Mayday Rooms too.

On the other hand, we are of course very much interested in housing struggles not as a topic, but as a struggle we'd very much like to support in some way. How do you reckon a syllabus might be useful, if at all, for your contexts? What areas should be covering? Whom could it address?
While we really like the idea of being able to work with you guys in a small, closed workshop over the two days, if you have specific friends and comrades from the housing struggles that you wish to invite that would work, please feel free to invite them, but we pretty much like to keep things quite intimate for this time (and maybe plot a follow up as a more open event?). 

This is the very first workshop with which we would like to bootstrap the whole project. We are happy that you are our friends and that we all are friends knowing and (most of us) working with each other before. We see these two days as part of the further development of our proposed workflows and at the same time the initial development of a 'Housing Struggles Syllabus' proper if this is something you feel you might be interested in beyond this one workshop. There could be a follow up on both of those threads in the future. This workflow relies a lot on the collaborative tools for (open source) software development. There are many issues which are successfully addressed in that context and it would be great to translate and "localize" it for other collaborative development contexts. Some of the examples are: better traces of who did what/when, a possibility to "fork" what is already done and localize it further (e.g. berlin, belgrade or zagreb forking and developing further the syllabus made in london, with traces how those branches were developed). 

There are a couple of important aspects to the syllabus itself that you should be aware in advance: first, it is topical and specific to a struggle - this means that once we create it for a type of struggle - e.g. housing struggle - that you were engaged in, other people in similar struggles will be able to make their own iterations - expanding and replacing segments with their resources and insights. Each iteration will be preserved. Second, it condenses a situated knowledge as a list of resources with some idea of its future use - is it for preservation, is it for mobilisaiton, is it for pedagogy, all of the above, none of the above. Third, we want the list to link to available digital resources: some texts and materials might be available in digital form, but others not - and we would like to digitise those, create a collection and make it available online so the syllabus can link those. In your case, this could be materials (from the 56a archive or others?) that speak to your engagement around housing struggles and you would like to digitise and put online. Maybe you think about it in advance and bring those materials to the workshop.
